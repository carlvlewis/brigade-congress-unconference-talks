### TITLE: "Slack is Eating the Community: Ehtical and logistical problems; alternatives and workarounds; going cold turkey and weaning off Slack-diction"
>Just as the noble ideal of *digital democracy* hasn't exactly panned out as we thought it would (**yet**), Slack – once hailed as a panacea to the deluge of crowded email inboxes –– has failed to live up to its expectations, too, and I urge here that open-source communities find alternatives to Slack as it stands in fundamental opposition to all for which we stand.

#### CONS:
+ Slack is fundamentally in diametric opposition to `working in the open.`
+ Not open-source, so why do we use it for open-source projects? Makes. No. Sense.
+ Synchronous to the point of `data obesity` – a.k.a. information overload
+ Only those `@here` at any given time are part of conversation – no scheduling of these spontaneous discussions, etiher. We all lead different lives with different schedules.
+ High barrier-to-entry for some; others actively dislike and choose not to use because of its lack of structure and designed expectations of synchronous response.
+ Lack of semantic structure that provides a narrative, organizes knowledge in human fashion.
+ API that conveniently (*for Slack*) allows lots of incoming data sources but hardly any simple ways of pushing data out of Slack elsewhere.
	+ Sub-issue: A bot could theoretically be built but it would still (a) likely require use of `/` command in Slack and, in turn, conscious actions on part of user and (b) it would need advanced ML and textual analysis to structure information from Slack in proper taxonomy.
+ Assumption exists among many that because it was posted in Slack, everyone knows about it. WRONG. Sorry, Charlie.
+ Cumbersome to maintain availability types: `here`/`away`/`do not disturb` status. Why can't I simply go on "vacation mode"?
+ Only those with experience working on tech teams usually have prior habit of keeping Slack open. Thus, others outside of tech backgrounds rarely log on to see mentions/messages.
+ Public servants find Slack befuddling, to say the least.
+ If what we're doing is too unimportant for email notifications, are we really saying our work is important?
+ Slack definitely isn't `meeting people where they are`.
+ Slack is like the office water cooler, which is fine. But do we really want to hang out at the office water cooler all day and do our work there?
+ You hit the 10K message limit *way* faster than you think; at that point, you permamently begin losing shared knowledge.
+ Has a short-and-fast format that discourages thoughtful feedback
+ Typically lacking context of what's being discussed -- particularly for visual work
+ Slack is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the Interaction Design Foundation. Its addiction rate is high, and user habit leads to inability to switch.
+ Inaccessible *by default* rather than *open by default*; you must *at least* make an account with Slackin (*if that's set up*) just to *view* content.
+ Mistaken belief that Slack messages aren't committed to permalink, which makes abuse and violations of CoC more likely. WRONG! Slack messages do have permalinks.
+ Slack chat often used *in lieu of* IRL meetings or video conferences; 

### Pros:
+ Stickiness (also a *con*; see: `slack addiction`)
+ Emotional design 
+ Ecosystem of integrations
+ Channels allow new ideas to spring forth organically
+ Sociality; builds relationships across geographic spaces in addition to getting work done.

> Question for consideration: Do any of the above pros merit a `competitive advantage` for Slack that can't be built by others? (definition: 'a condition or circumstance that puts a company in a favorable or superior business position.')
 
### Needs for alternatives to have:
+ Real-time chat.
+ Emojis. :sunglasses: More emojis. :joy: Did I mention emojis? :fire:
+ Collaborative, real-time document editing
+ File-sharing
+ Wiki-type 
+ Low barrier to entry
+ Ideally, some integration with email for public servants.
+ Open by default.

### Current alternatives:
+ [matrix](https://matrix.org/) - Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. There are an array of clients and servers available, think modern IRC
+ [Gitter](https://gitter.im) - Real-time chat oriented around github orgs and projects. Acquired and open-sourced by GitLab.
+ [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) - Almost exactly the same as Slack but open-source and extendable. OPEN SOURCE!
+ [Mattermost](http://mattermost.com) - 
+ [GitHub](https://github.com) - Maybe we should just GitHub more and utilize all the tools built around GitHub?
+ [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) - Oldie but a goodie. Considered in project management circles as baseline, simplest yet most functional project tool.
+ [Notion.so](http://notion.so) ($$$, but a perfectly legal hack exists that's in line with their ToS)
+ [Quip](http://getquip.com) - Fantastic for collaborative documents; great chat; rather expensive; no current ability to make group folders publicly editable/viewable `by default`.
+ [Discourse](http://discourse.org) - On its face, an ideal, extendable solution that *should* work but never has caught on; people have this odd and illogical ideological opposition to 'forums' -- likely thanks to the early days of the Web.
+ [Dropbox Paper](http://paper.dropbox.com) - Very nice UI that pulls users in; individual papers can be made publicly available for editing and viewing; collections cannot.
+ [GSuite](http://suite.google.com) - Documents too print-centric; vast array of options distracts from core experience of authoring text; Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, Hangouts all exist in separate Google silos.
+ [Laddr](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/laddr) - Original CMS and project facilitator for brigades. Integrates with Slack and Discourse.
+ [BrigadeHub](https://brigadehub.github.io) - Project of c4sf. Development discontinued.

### Issues
+ Switching costs (not financial or data migration costs but *habit* costs)
+ May alienate developer community that uses Slack for 18 different teams
+ Lack of integrations for other alternatives
+ Getting people to use alternatives; Slack withdrawal syndrome; no current tapering drug.
+ More TK

### Slacktivism?
